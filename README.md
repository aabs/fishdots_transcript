# fishdots_transcript

Transcript, to keep track of what you are working on, who you spoke to and so on.  The idea being to create an event based ecosystem of interesting events and ways to use and consume them.  

## IDEAS

1. Provide commands for things like:

- conversations, tracking who, what and when
- decisions
- thoughts
- tasks completed
- tasks started
- tasks queued

2. Use fish shell events to hook into other plugins to either get or provide inputs.
3. Hook into social media to broadcast or receive events that may be worth capturing
4. Decouple the system(s) that generate the events from those that act on them
5. Have a variety of ways to handle events (i.e. log to notes, standup comms, social media, time trackers, ledgers, taskwarrior etc)

## Events

- New meeting
- New conversation
- New Idea
- New task
- Task started
- Task finished
- Task halted
- New Decision
- New note created
- New Problem
- Problem Solved
